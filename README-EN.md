## Version Notation Conventions
- It basically follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) notation (x.y.z)
- x : Raise 1 for large updates (SDJK 1.0 -> SDJK 2.0, Old SC KRM -> SC KRM if it is newly created or changed very much like this)
- y : Raise 1 when a lot of changes have been made by working on APIs, adding or changing classes.
- z : Raise 1 when you've done something like an API, added or changed a class, but the change is small
- If x is 0, this means an early development version (doesn't have to follow the version notation perfectly)
